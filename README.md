## Asset_customization
Wanted to try another layout style using 100vh blocks. Created/Modified alot of the assets in this website like the background & navigation buttons. Not fully finished product and realized some problems this popular layout problem caused. Theme for the website was a small introduction about me an with filler text.

## KH-responsive-design
Made a hobby website about a interest I had containing one of my favourite video games. Learned alot off CSS and how to make things scale to different screen sizes. The website introduces a lot of the characters as pictures so managing all these different sized pictures on different screen sizes was a fun way to practice. Overall like how the webpage design turned out and was one of my 1st websites I really worked on.

## Yrityssivut
We were given a task to design a potential website that would suit a real company. The website had to be responsive and to have a really stable/clean layout. I really put effort into the responsives and styling this website making sure it really felt like a real product. I also used some JS and solour themes on this website.
