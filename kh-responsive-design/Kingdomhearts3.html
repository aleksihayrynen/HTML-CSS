                    <p>Ansem, Seeker of Darkness is Xehanort's Heartless Due to him having intentionally separated his heart from his body and soul before he gave into the darkness, 
                        Ansem retained his selfhood, and intelligence after his transformation into a Heartless. Because he could think out his plans and pass for a human, he was able to 
                        destroy nearly every world in the Kingdom Hearts universe without revealing his identity, up until he confronted Sora at the Final Keyhole in Hollow Bastion </p>
